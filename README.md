# hello-world

Hai!

I'm PK, from the ##SpoonFed channel on Freenode.  If you're a hacker, admin, pen-tester, 
technician, or just all-around geek, feel free to pop in and say hi!  We love to meet
new people from all ranges of experience, to share knowledge and ideas.  We encourage 
everyone to ask some questions or help answer someone else's, because no matter how
smart you are, there's always someone you can learn something new from!  :)

This is just my run through the github tutorial to gain some familiarity, before I start 
hosting a few security-related projects here.
